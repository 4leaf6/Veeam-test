This is my first application test for the position of Junior QA Tester.

This assignment was to create a script for a web browser of my choice to automate the commands below:
  1. Open https://careers.veeam.com/vacancies and maximize the browser window.
  2. Using the jobs filter on the page, count the number of Sales positions in two locations: 
    - USA, Texas, Austin
    - Romania, Bucharest
  3. Count positions by choosing the correct filter settings, pressing search 
  button and counting blocks that represent open positions.
  4. Compare the number of positions with the expected result for each location
